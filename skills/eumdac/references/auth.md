# Authentication And Credentials

Use this reference for credential safety, `set-credentials`, token checks, Python authentication, and subscription credentials.

## Credential Safety

EUMDAC Data Store authentication uses an EO Portal consumer key and consumer secret. Never echo real values in answers, command logs, shell history examples, or committed files.

`eumdac set-credentials` writes credentials to the local EUMDAC configuration. In `eumdac 3.1.1`, the default path is:

```text
~/.eumdac/credentials
```

If `EUMDAC_CONFIG_DIR` is set, the credentials path becomes:

```text
$EUMDAC_CONFIG_DIR/credentials
```

Before recommending or running `set-credentials`, check whether credentials already exist:

```bash
python - <<'PY'
import os
from pathlib import Path

config_dir = Path(os.environ.get("EUMDAC_CONFIG_DIR", Path.home() / ".eumdac"))
credentials = config_dir / "credentials"
print(credentials)
print("exists" if credentials.exists() else "missing")
PY
```

If the file exists, do not overwrite it by default. Validate existing credentials with:

```bash
eumdac token
```

Only suggest `set-credentials` when the file is missing, invalid, or the user explicitly asks to replace credentials. The user runs this command themselves, in their own terminal, with their real key and secret; the agent never runs it with real values and never asks the user to paste secrets into the chat. The user should avoid shell history capture, for example a leading space with `HISTCONTROL=ignorespace` set, or the shell's equivalent. Use placeholders in any command shown here:

```bash
eumdac set-credentials "<consumer-key>" "<consumer-secret>"
eumdac token
```

If replacing credentials, warn that the local credentials file will be overwritten.

`eumdac token --force` revokes the current token and can affect other processes using the same credentials. Warn before suggesting it.

## Python Authentication

Use placeholders for examples:

```python
import eumdac

credentials = ("<consumer-key>", "<consumer-secret>")
token = eumdac.AccessToken(credentials)
```

`AccessToken(credentials, validity=86400, cache=True)` is the installed `eumdac 3.1.1` signature. The default validity is one day.

## Subscription Credentials

Subscriptions have their own credential command. The user runs this themselves, in their own terminal, with their real username and password; the agent never runs it with real values and never asks the user to paste secrets into the chat. The user should avoid shell history capture, for example a leading space with `HISTCONTROL=ignorespace` set, or the shell's equivalent.

```bash
eumdac subscribe set-credentials "<username>" "<password>"
```

Treat subscription usernames/passwords as secrets too. Subscription credentials are stored under the EUMDAC config directory at:

```text
~/.eumdac/subscriptions/credentials
```

or, when `EUMDAC_CONFIG_DIR` is set:

```text
$EUMDAC_CONFIG_DIR/subscriptions/credentials
```

Check for that file before overwriting subscription credentials.
