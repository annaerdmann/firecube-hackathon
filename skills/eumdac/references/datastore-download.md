# Data Store Download

Use this reference for `download` workflows, product package entries, integrity checks, coverage downloads, Data Tailor-on-download, and output layout.

## Basic Download

Download by search criteria:

```bash
eumdac download --collection "<collection-id>" --start "2024-01-01" --end "2024-01-02" --limit 1 --output-dir ./data
```

Download with an area filter:

```bash
eumdac download --collection "<collection-id>" --bbox -5.0 45.0 5.0 55.0 --start "2024-01-01" --end "2024-01-02" --limit 1 --output-dir ./data
```

Download explicit product IDs:

```bash
eumdac download --collection "<collection-id>" --product "<product-id>" --output-dir ./data
```

`<product-id>` is the exact string `eumdac search` prints, suffix included; a product ID is an opaque identifier, not a filename to normalise. A `Not found (404)` on a product that search just listed means the ID was altered, not that the product is gone.

Useful download options:

```text
--integrity                  verify md5 when available
--entry "<pattern>"          filter product files by shell-style wildcard
--download-coverage <code>   mission-specific coverage subset
--tailor / --chain <chain>   customize via chain ID, file, or YAML string
--local-tailor <id>          use configured local Data Tailor instance
--onedir / --dirs            choose output directory layout
--threads <n>                parallel connections
--no-progress-bars           quieter automation output
--yes / -y                   auto-confirm the download prompt
```

Prefer `--limit` for exploratory downloads. Confirm storage/quota expectations before suggesting broad downloads.

Pass `--yes`/`-y` only after the user has authorised that specific download: product count, total size, and destination stated and agreed. It skips the CLI's own confirmation prompt, so it does not replace stating those numbers and getting authorisation first; use it to keep an already-authorised download from stalling on an interactive prompt under `timeout`.

## Advanced Downloading

Download only selected files inside product packages using shell-style entry patterns:

```bash
eumdac download --collection "<collection-id>" --product "<product-id>" --entry "*.nat" --output-dir ./data
```

Verify integrity when MD5 is available:

```bash
eumdac download --collection "<collection-id>" --product "<product-id>" --integrity --output-dir ./data
```

Choose output layout:

```bash
eumdac download --collection "<collection-id>" --product "<product-id>" --onedir --output-dir ./data
eumdac download --collection "<collection-id>" --product "<product-id>" --dirs --output-dir ./data
```

Use parallel connections carefully:

```bash
eumdac download --collection "<collection-id>" --start "2024-01-01" --end "2024-01-02" --limit 10 --threads 4
```

Use mission-specific coverage downloads only where supported:

```bash
eumdac download --collection "<collection-id>" --product "<product-id>" --download-coverage FD
```

Supported coverage values in `eumdac 3.1.1` are:

```text
FD H1 H2 T1 T2 T3 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4
```

Use Data Tailor customisation during download with a chain ID, file, or YAML string:

```bash
eumdac download --collection "<collection-id>" --product "<product-id>" --chain "<chain-id-or-file>" --output-dir ./tailored
```

Use a configured local Data Tailor instance:

```bash
eumdac download --collection "<collection-id>" --product "<product-id>" --chain "<chain-id-or-file>" --local-tailor "<local-tailor-id>"
```

`--bbox`/`--geometry` filter which products are selected. `--download-coverage` and Data Tailor affect downloaded/customised output where supported.

## Validation

Credential-free validation:

```bash
eumdac download --help
```

Live download validation requires credentials, network access, storage space, and real collection/product IDs.

## Size And Space Before Downloading

Any skill that hands off a download to EUMDAC, including a calling skill such as `firecube`, follows this procedure end to end; it is self-contained and does not assume prior steps happened elsewhere.

1. Identify the products: run the search/filter that matches the user's request and confirm the collection and filters.
2. Count them: the CLI search output does not show a count directly, so run the same search with `--limit` under `timeout` and count the results, or use the Python API's search results.
3. Get an expected size from the Python API before committing to a download:

   ```python
   import eumdac
   token = eumdac.AccessToken(("<consumer-key>", "<consumer-secret>"))
   datastore = eumdac.DataStore(token)
   product = datastore.get_product("<collection-id>", "<product-id>")
   print(product.size)  # bytes
   ```

   Treat `Product.size` as a hint only: the catalogue-reported size does not always match the delivered archive size. If unsure, download one product, measure the file on disk, and multiply by the count instead of trusting the reported value.
4. Get the destination directory from the user; never invent or reuse a path from a project or another tool.
5. Check free space there:

   ```bash
   df -h <output-dir>
   ```

6. State the product count, total size, and destination together and get authorisation once, before running anything that downloads data.
7. Run the download under `timeout`, printing one progress line before it starts and one result line after it ends.
8. Report the destination directory where the files landed. If another skill or workflow requested the download, report that directory back to it so the calling workflow can continue.
